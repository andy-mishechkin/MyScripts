# MyScript
This is my PowerShell\Bash scripts for admin\devops tasks.
I've created these scripts for my own needs, therefore I didn't have goal to create highly professional code.
But some in these scripts may be useful to everyone, so I decided to create the public repository on GitHub.
Some of these scripts also placed in PowerShell gallery: https://www.powershellgallery.com/profiles/Andy_M

Every script conatins small description in the header - just open this script in any editor for reading.
List of scripts in root:
- ShowTcpConnections.ps1 - script for getting the TCP connections and print information to the screen. Used for checking and monitoring of TCP connections.
